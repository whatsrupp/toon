## An Instagram knock-off for doodlers

Not really too much to say about this at the moment, other than capybara testing file uploads is proving to be horrific.


MVP:

```
As anyone
So that I can peruse so sick snaps
I need to be able to see a list of all images

```

```
As a prospective user
So that I can reuse this interstellar product again
I need to be able to log in
```

```
As anyone
So that I can get a close up of the juiciest of portraits
I need to be able to click through to a single image
```

Ok, going to drop the slightly long-hand user stories
